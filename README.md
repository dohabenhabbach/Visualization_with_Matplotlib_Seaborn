## About

Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding complex datasets and conveying information to both technical and non-technical audiences. In this repository, you will find:

- **Matplotlib Visualizations:** Matplotlib is a versatile library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. Explore a range of chart types, including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and more.

- **Seaborn Visualizations:** Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and offers a high-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations. Discover how to create informative pair plots, heatmaps, distribution plots, and more.

- **Sample Datasets:** We've included sample datasets that you can use to recreate the visualizations and practice your data visualization skills.

## Getting Started
